*I received a weird PDF from a friend.*
DOC{payload.pdf;payload.pdf;Weird PDF}

</br>

When opening the PDF, a window with the text "You are hacked!" is displayed and the calculator of the end device opened.

If the PDF is opened in a text editor, the responsible JavaScript function can be found in line 32. 
```
/JS (app.alert\("You are hacked!"\); app.launchURL\("START C:/\Windows/\system32/\calc.exe", true\); console.println\("bmxhbmR7ajR2NDVjMjFwNzo3aDNfOTAwZF9wNDI3NX0="\);)
```
At the end of the function a Base64 string is written to the console which can be converted to the flag with [CyberChef FromBase64](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Base64('A-Za-z0-9%2B/%3D',true,false)&input=Ym14aGJtUjdhalIyTkRWak1qRndOem8zYUROZk9UQXdaRjl3TkRJM05YMD0).

The flag is ```nland{j4v45c21p7:7h3_900d_p4275}```.
