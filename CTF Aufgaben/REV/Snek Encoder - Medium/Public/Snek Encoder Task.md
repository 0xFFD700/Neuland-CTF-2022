# Snek Encoder

I encoded the flag with a custom script that I wrote. I lost the source code to it. I just found this odd file in the project folder. It seems to describe operations and commands in some way to encode the flag. Maybe this helps you to find a way to decode the flag.
This is the encoded flag: `urfrg}qy6f-jZ.e-'U]((QSi&!POf`.
