One of our Neuland members went on a trip to London. I tried to call her a few days ago but she didn't pick up. I am a bit worried as she missed our last meeting as well and we haven't heard back from her.
Can you find out what happened? Here is here email address as the phone number isn't of much use: elisabeth.hacker1337@gmail.com
It would be great if you could tell me the name of the city she is currently in.
