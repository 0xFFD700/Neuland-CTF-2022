A friend of mine sent me this nucleotide sequence. He told me that the corresponsidng enzyme supposedly supports muscle growth. That's excatly what I need. I need the amino acid sequence for my research and to try it out. Me friend however told me that I will have to work for it. I hope you didn't skip your biology lessions. Can you convert this nucleotide sequence into a amino acid sequence for me? 

Flag format: nland{Uppercase amino acid sequence}
