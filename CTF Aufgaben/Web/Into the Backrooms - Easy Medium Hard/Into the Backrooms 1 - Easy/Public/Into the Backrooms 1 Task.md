# Into the Backrooms 1

**Category: Web <br>
Difficulty: Easy <br>

This challenge has four different parts. The source code is always the same. The parts build on each other and you should work on them in their order.

I am currently working on the backend of a new shop system. It is still in development and not finished. Have a look for yourself and try to log into an account.
