Once you have finished the first part of the challenge you should know how to register a new account and how to log into it. If you are logged in, you are able to buy products. The shop has stickers, T-shirts and flags in stock. Of course we want to buy a flag as it does set the flag as a comment. The relevant code can be seen below:

```js
api.post('/buy/:article', (req, res) => {
	if(req.userUid == -1)
		return res.json({ error: true, msg: "Login first." })

	let article = req.params.article
	let err = null
	let comment = ''

	if(!req.body.quantity || !req.body.price)
		err = "Missing parameters."

	if(article == "t-shirt") {
			comment = "You will receive a T-shirt after the CTF."
	} else if(article == "sticker") {
			comment = "You can grab some stickers from the desk at the front."
	} else if(article == "flag") {
			comment = flag2
	} else err = "Product not in stock."

	if(err)
		return res.json({ error: true, msg: err})

	let total = req.body.quantity * req.body.price
	res.cookie('order',`${req.userOrder},${total}`)
	res.json({ error: false, msg: "Order submitted for " + total.toString() + " â‚¬.", comment: comment })
})
```

We need to send a post request to the endpoint `/buy/flag`. The body needs to contain a JSON with the fields `quantity` and `price`. The two cookies passwd and uid need to be set as well to the values of the created account. The response will then contain a comment with the second flag. An `order` cookie is set with the response as well.

The flag is `nland{w3lc0m3_70_y0ur_n3w_4cc0un7}`.
