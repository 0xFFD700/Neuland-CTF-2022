# Into the Backrooms 3

Difficulty: Hard <br>

This challenge has four different parts. The source code is always the same. The parts build on each other and you should work on them in their order.

The checkout function is still under development. Only the admin account is allowed to use it for testing. Don't even try to find a loophole and to dig deeper.
