In the image we can see the outlines of circles and stars that look suspiciously like a QR code. The special thing about QR Codes is that they contain a lot of redundancy and error-handling, so changing shapes does not affect functionality. If we change the color of the outer area to white, we get a scannable QR code containing the flag.

The flag is ```nland{411_814ck_3v32y7h1n9}```.
