I received this transmission from our moon station. The result looks odd. The technology we use for the transmissions is pretty old. It was already used back in the days. It's probably just a disturbance. It has been a long shift for me. So it might as well be me and I did something wrong while decoding. Can you have a look as well and tell me whats wrong with it? Something is out of place.

Submit your answer in lowercase and wrapped in nlad{}.

Please avoid playing the audio over and over again. It gets a bit annoying. There is a way to get the answer without playing the audio.
